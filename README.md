<h1>Scheme Interpreter</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Develop an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. Think about the issues that arise in the design of a programming language; many quirks of languages are byproducts of implementation decisions in interpreters and compilers. The subset of the language used in this project is described in the functional programming section of Composing Programs, as well as this language specification and built-in procedure reference.
